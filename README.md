In todayâ€™s technology-driven world, the ability to accurately detect human emotions from facial expressions holds significant potential across various domains, including healthcare, education, and customer service. Despite advancements in computer vision and machine learning, developing an emotion detection system that is both accurate and efficient remains a challenging task.

The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a robust and user-friendly emotion detection application that leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify emotions from uploaded images. The application will be built using Streamlit, providing a seamless user experience, while the underlying emotion classification model will be trained on the FER-2013 dataset to ensure high accuracy and performance.
